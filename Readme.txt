 Speaker 1: Welcome to date of this podcast I'm Jeff bar tab speak with Bob Rogers of Intel corporation Bob is the chief data scientist for big data solutions before we get started one quick note Due to an error on my part I failed to record my side of the conversation instead of troubling Bob for a second interview I simply listen to his answer and jeffardy style to buy best to create some sort of a questions welcome to the podcast Bob 
 
hi Jeff thanks it's really great to be here.

Speaker 1: Give me a sense of what you do as a data scientist 

so I I can I can tell you about my my role and then we can we can kind of expand that to. To Broader broader data scientist roles So as chief data scientist for big data at Intel I work with both our internal analytics teams and also Our customers to help them really get the most out of analytics and It so that they asked the right questions that they know how to use their data that they're using their their analytics and data center stack in the most up most valuable way possible I see my mission as Putting powerful analytics in the hands of every decision maker So that that has Of a an implication that It's it's not just business decision makers it's not just The most advanced data scientists but it's people who are doing analytics all the way down from you know from people who are just transitioning from analytics and about you know analysis roles To To really full blown data scientists.

Speaker 1: Now give the phrases big data and data scientists are both very recent terms how did you get to where you are.

Speaker 1: So my my career path was as with many data scientists was a A winding and I'm definitely not when you're one I started with a PhD in physics I was an astrophysicist And my work involved doing computer simulations of.
Speaker 1: Stuff Falling into a supermassive black holes and so Early on this is a late eighties early nineties that was fairly computer a Kind of work for an astrophysicist I got interested during my post doc and Computing the way the brain computes with artificial neural networks and ended up. Doing both academic work and writing a book on time series for casting with an all nuts and Lo and behold I ended up running and Running a hedge fund for twelve years so people Literally started calling me and asking me When I was a post on Hey Can you forecast stock market with your technology and I thought well that sounds like a good a good use case So turned out I knew somebody who had a a trading firm We started a new company and ended up.
Speaker 0: Being very successful for twelve years doing quantitative trading in the futures markets.
Speaker 1: So that was an interesting twist for a.
Speaker 0: For a.
Speaker 1: Physicist.
Speaker 0: It was a good introduction to big data in.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety two we had at.
Speaker 0: The two giga byte dataset of tick by tick transactions from the from the futures markets and so was at an.
Speaker 1: Early application.
Speaker 0: Of trying to figure out how to use a large volume of data including a large volume of streaming data from the markets.
Speaker 1: To.
Speaker 0: Do real time analytics now back in those days of course I had no idea that was data science.
Speaker 1: Here's one interesting one interesting set of stops along the way.
Speaker 0: Which.
Speaker 1: Was in the health care space so.
Speaker 0: Following the.
Speaker 1: Following the hedge fund.
Speaker 0: I actually became global product manager for the.
Speaker 1: World's gold standard.
Speaker 0: Diagnostic device for glaucoma management.
Speaker 1: Which was.
Speaker 0:
Speaker 1: You know very interesting.
Speaker 0: To see how health care works in general and what I realized was that data is is or lack there of is a huge problem in health care and that that healthcare is really needed some some technology to bring clarity to.
Speaker 1: To.
Speaker 0: How healthcare is delivered and how to improve that so in two thousand nine the government did something very interesting they said we're gonna incentivize doctors to use electronic medical records.
Speaker 1: The idea was take these paper silos which are those you know those color coded charts that we all see in the doctor's office take those papers silos of data turn them into.
Speaker 0: An electronic form so that health care can be optimized as a system.
Speaker 0: Currently we pay twice as much as comparable industrialized nations for our health care but by most quality measures were actually lagging behind.
Speaker 1: So the idea from the government was okay let's get the date electronic.
Speaker 0: And let's let's optimize the system.
Speaker 1: The catch.
Speaker 0: Is that the paper silos became electronic silos.
Speaker 1: Each.
Speaker 0: System was a local database and had no inter operability to all the other system so we have the same problem but the data was an electronic form.
Speaker 1: So I'd to for other.
Speaker 0: Three other co founders formed a company called the pixie in two thousand nine.
Speaker 1: To address those challenges.
Speaker 0: The idea was to bring the data up to the cloud.
Speaker 1: Build build a.
Speaker 0: A technology to normalize all that data so that you could create a complete computable view of a patient's history what we call the true state of the patient.
Speaker 1: And so couple of a couple of really interesting findings which will bear later on our discussion.
Speaker 1: We thought Hey you know when you bring all the despair at data from all the sources together for a patient and you look at their stare coated.
Speaker 0: Conditions for example what's called the problem list so it's all your diagnoses.
Speaker 1: We figured Hey you're going to have the whole story on the patient when we aggregated the data.
Speaker 0: We discovered that sixty three percent of what your doctor needs to know about you is actually missing from the structured data.
Speaker 1: Which was a huge shocker at least to us.
Speaker 0: Our.
Speaker 1: It turns out that physicians kind of already knew this then if you turn it around the other way and say okay well what's in the structured problem list.
Speaker 0: And.
Speaker 1: You look at for example a.
Speaker 0: A set.
Speaker 1: Of.
Speaker 0: Patients who have heart failure in their problem list.
Speaker 1: Heart failure is.
Speaker 0: Really serious you have a five year life expectancy.
Speaker 1: You're in and out of the hospital your patient who really requires.
Speaker 0: A high touch management program to to keep you out of the hospital.
Speaker 1: So we pulled a set of patients with heart failure on their problem list.
Speaker 0: And it turned out that thirty to fifty percent of those patients do not actually have heart failure it's a false positive in the system.
Speaker 1: So all of a sudden you're looking at an information system and driving healthcare informatics.
Speaker 0: On.
Speaker 1: Data with lots of false negatives and lots of false positives.
Speaker 0: What do you do and.
Speaker 1: And you know what to what to practitioners doing the root and the real world I mean doctors.
Speaker 0: Are our challenge but they're not they're not that challenged.
Speaker 1: The answer.
Speaker 0: And this is where the big data really comes in the answer was in the tax and the scanned documents.
Speaker 1: So if you see a cardiologists that cardiologists will write a letter to your doctor.
Speaker 0: Describing the.
Speaker 1: Encounter telling you telling your doctor all about I.
Speaker 0: I saw your patient Bob Rogers I did a work up for heart.
Speaker 1: Disease here's what I found here the recommendations that letter is an image that gets scanned into your.
Speaker 0: Electronic health record.
Speaker 1: So what we did is.
Speaker 0: And of course you can imagine that is the the media S. piece of clinical documentation you can imagine.
Speaker 1: So what we did is we built a day.
Speaker 0: Big data stack that could analyze the taxed.
Speaker 1: It could.
Speaker 0: Extract the text from the scanned documents and analyze that.
Speaker 1: Put it all in context with.
Speaker 0: The rest of the structure data ads do machine learning to actually understand which pieces of information are most likely to be correct.
Speaker 1: And.
Speaker 0: And create this computable true state of the patient.
Speaker 1: So it ended up being a really interesting exercise in.
Speaker 0: Building a big data stacked and extracting a variety of different kinds of information from that that very data.
Speaker 1: Ultimately if I understand what you're saying then that huge amount of structure data really boil down to actually a sentence or two on the final report from the doctor.
Speaker 1: Yeah absolutely in fact one of the one of the things I see in my role.
Speaker 0: As chief data scientist for big data at Intel.
Speaker 1: Is you know I work with customers a lot who's who are in various.
Speaker 0: Places in their journey for.
Speaker 1: Big data analytics.
Speaker 0: But they all have the vision for what they need you know this is the challenge that we have so.
Speaker 1:
Speaker 1: So when I sit down with them.
Speaker 0: And talk to them about how to get to that vision.
Speaker 1: The.
Speaker 0: End of the.
Speaker 1: The first place I like to concentrate on is how do you how do you get early and meaningful value from.
Speaker 0: An analytics project.
Speaker 1: And you know this is in the context that they have been.
Speaker 0: Working with their enterprise data warehouse and some of their structured data for many many years and they've.
Speaker 0: Although it may not be a data science project and and that and that again hopefully I can get back to your question about data science sort of across the board but.
Speaker 1: Are you know even with their analysts they've been looking at this data how do we go from assembling more of the same structure data to actually new insights and the answer is in many cases wearing in one kind.
Speaker 0: Of unstructured data that they haven't used before.
Speaker 1: Because they've been beating on this the structure data for years and.
Speaker 0: You know by hook or by crook they've gained insights from it but.
Speaker 1: When.
Speaker 0: My experience is that when you take one piece of unstructured data that's relevant.
Speaker 1: And.
Speaker 0: In a corporation into the problem.
Speaker 1: You.
Speaker 0: Learn things that you just never even imagined before.
Speaker 1: So that's that's sort of the the the.
Speaker 0: Approach that I like to take whenever possible on it it's.
Speaker 1: It's it's it's quite eliminating.
Speaker 1: So it sounds to me like in some cases this relatively simple final step this text extraction can be all the takes to capture the value of all of the prior sophisticated big data analysis is that a reasonable way to think about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah absolutely and in fact that touches upon another really important point that I like to make to my.
Speaker 0: You know my enterprise customers when I'm advising them which is.
Speaker 1: Don't.
Speaker 0: Jump immediately to the assumption that you need to have.
Speaker 1: A full blown cognitive computing stack to understand unstructured data for your use case it's often quite sufficient to use simple tools first.
Speaker 0: So for instance doing text mining.
Speaker 1: To.
Speaker 0: Extract meaningful references to diagnoses.
Speaker 1: In all this tax will actually.
Speaker 0: Allow you to focus on the pieces of information that are most valuable without going to an entire natural language processing and you know cognitive type of stacking of course those things are all very interesting and valuable going forward but when you've got your training wheels on that's not where you want to start.
Speaker 1: So Bob I have to say that a cognitive computing stack sounds like a really cool thing to have what you actually need water not.
Speaker 1: That's right that's right my customers would be excited about the cognitive computing stack.
Speaker 0: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Well that's really where things are going.
Speaker 0: But a but you know I'm.
Speaker 1: Much of much of industry is.
Speaker 0: Is still very.
Speaker 1:
Speaker 0: Anxious to get on the on the train and the first the first stop is definitely bringing in that unstructured data and.
Speaker 1: And actually having the the.
Speaker 0: You know scalability to analyze lots of lots of unstructured data coming in from potentially many sources.
Speaker 1: When you're talking to potential users and they listen to you talking about big data and analytics and all this value they can get from it they see the benefits they want to get started what kinds of guidance do you offer them how do they get into the school New World that you're describing.
Speaker 1: Yeah so that's a great question and and they're really two major pieces to that one is.
Speaker 0: About.
Speaker 1: Thinking about the the data.
Speaker 0: And the other is thinking about the team in the process around getting insights.
Speaker 1: So one of the.
Speaker 0: One of the mistakes I see happening.
Speaker 1: Is that.
Speaker 0: People think that when they break down the barriers between their silo data within the organization and they put everything into a single data center data hub or data like.
Speaker 1: That the.
Speaker 0: The insights are just gonna magically bubble to the surface of that data like and of course.
Speaker 1: The there's there's a reason for that because analysts have been stymied by.
Speaker 0: Organizational barriers.
Speaker 1: To access.
Speaker 0: And and transform data for their analytics needs.
Speaker 1: So of course when.
Speaker 0: When they're presented with the possibility to bring all that data into a single data center it's very exciting possibility and they.
Speaker 1: They they don't.
Speaker 0: They don't see beyond that too what are the other challenges.
Speaker 1: So so again one of the one of the pieces of advice is to is to think very carefully about.
Speaker 0: What does that data mean.
Speaker 1: Build.
Speaker 0: A modeling context for the data so that you really.
Speaker 1: You really have.
Speaker 1: Real meaning for each set.
Speaker 0: Of data that you bring into your into your.
Speaker 1: Your system so that's a little bit of an architecture up front you know despite the fact that.
Speaker 0: That the state it could be scheme unless it doesn't mean that it's it's not organized.

Speaker 2: It sounds to me like this is a job that requires a really wide variety of skills how does a young person educate and prepare themselves for a career as a data scientist.
Speaker 2: So that that's a that's a great question people are asking me out a lot so that actually ties very nicely to my second point about extracting value from all this data because again you're right it's it's not just big data it's data it's a variety of data it's data coming in at at at at different speeds and cadences and like seats so what's happened in the enterprise as big data has involved is that the process of gaining insights from data has changed from a sort of rigid process in which a business owner asks for a report with some specific hypothesis of mind and then an analyst goes and creates that report so it's a very it's sort of it is it's a very rigid.
Speaker 2: And not interactive approach.
Speaker 2: Two now we're looking at a process in which business owners.
Speaker 2: People who are good at at the mass and the status of the analyzing the data itself and then also the people who are good with the programming and the and the concept extraction of getting the the building the machinery to get the value out of the data those three sets of people are actually working together entered a plea to identify problems and then to solve those problems an ongoing basis so it's gone from a you know call and response type of situation two a again L. alive alive jam sort of if if if you want to use a musical analogy so these so the the question for young people who have technical skills for example is what is what are the pieces that build that create that team that's going to get the value for the data it's it's it's a technical piece around Mathur stats are modeling there's programming ads ads being able to use all the analytics tools and then there's an understanding and appreciation for the business use cases in the business needs now usually you're not gonna find all three of those things in one person and in fact I tell students don't worry about about being that person we call that a data science unicorn right the the the unicorn has those three attributes all in full representation in one person very very rare but and in fact you know the not even necessarily you know certainly not required so when you're when you're building a team what you're looking for someone who's really really strong and at least one of those skills and then is is conversant in the others so if you've got a technical background you wanna you wanna be doing some you know some programming to at some level so that you appreciate and understand the tools and that you can kind of plug in and articulate.
Speaker 2: To the more you know computer scientist types what what you need to develop or what you need them to develop one of the the roles that I often see is actually someone with business a business Rall who's good at communicating with the technical folks and so can kind of pull the skill sets together so so to summarize if I'm talking to technical people understand.
Speaker 2: You know thinking about what what the sensitivities are for the business or what the how to communicate to the people who are building the tools is a is a key set of of capabilities that you don't have to be that person you need to communicate with that person and in fact one of the the best ways to articulate that is it's an it's an ability.
Speaker 2: That you want to nurturing yourself to understand what's important to others.
Speaker 2: So you know for instance as a technical person talking to the business folks I know all about the the the stats in the in the modeling and the underlying tools and the and the and the limitations of the data the statistical certainties but what's important to the business user may be some distilled version of that like what does this mean to the business and how reliable is it or what action can I take and under what circumstances should I be cautious about that action so that's the the translation and so rather than trying to be a unicorn be a good communicator and and and be empathetic.
Speaker 2: Now some developers perhaps even be in a younger life just want to sit in court all day and never talked to anybody.
Speaker 2: I get the sense from what you're telling me that communication skills are is it safe to say that someone who has a really wide variety of technical business and communication skills would be a great data scientist really important here.
Speaker 2: Right right exactly and I have seen that repeatedly I mean one of the pieces of advice is you know how how do I build the slide for an executive wall don't start with your cabbie out you've you've done all this technical work you've got cab yachts and assumptions and probabilities you want to make sure you footnote that stuff but lead with the conclusion lead with the with the with the the take away and then cabbie out when you're talking to technical folks you probably do set up the problem and all the assumptions up front but that's it's a different it's a different slide when you're presenting it to executives even if all the same information is there so yeah that's the key thing.
Speaker 2: Is it safe to say that someone who has a really wide variety of technical business and communication skills would be a great data scientist.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's an opportunity to really bring things together in ways that are powerful effect I my background I I was soccer player for a good portion of my life and one of the most exciting things about soccer is seeing when you get the connections between the players you get a synergy work team suddenly elevates to a new level that's that's something that data science has in common with soccer that you you have this ability to kind of put these pieces together and see another level of performance and insight come out of the process which is really exciting and it and it's what business needs going forward okay so without what is Intel's role in all of this.
Speaker 2: Yeah so I mean many people wonder why does Intel happen chief data scientist for big data because you know we're we're manufacturing chips and the chipster are you know in the systems that are being developed by other.
Speaker 2: Other industry players add the answer is that Intel believes very strongly that.
Speaker 2: If our if we can help our customers be successful with their analytics then they're going to invest more in the data center and if they invest for the data center that's going to have a strong pull through to Intel architecture and particularly when these workloads really work extremely well on Intel architecture so the result of that is that a lot of what we do is to help industry be successful with analytics and to enable them through both education also through tools so there are three major areas that Intel invests very helpfully and in big data and analytics.
Speaker 2: There is the internet of things and that's interesting from a number of points of view but you the the way we think about it is how do we how do we integrate create integrated solutions and technologies that can start at the sensor out on the edge have enough intelligence to know what to do with that data and how to respond out the edge and then of course also push that data back efficiently to the data center where we can do even more sophisticated and integrated analytics on that data so that's see that's an ecosystem that were that were always thinking about because there's an opportunity for intelligence to be present and in every link in that chain so that's very relevant to everything we're doing it and tell on those those streaming workloads from sensors and from the internet of things are super interesting from an analytics point of view so that's one another huge area of of work at Intel's just around optimizing workloads of all kinds so that they perform as well as they can on Intel architecture and so we are we have a huge team optimizing individual software and area because of my health care back on one of the areas it's really exciting about that from his work we've done with gene sequencing systems to actually optimize their stack from the bottom up all the way to the top terms of you know how the how the the software is calling the mass libraries in the on the chip all the way up to how the the whole analytics pipeline is is organized and we've actually taken the time to generate a gene sequence for human from days typically seven days down to hours and that you know in itself is a huge and impressive performance game but actually has human meaning because it turns out that genetic to.
Speaker 2: Diseases such as cancer.
Speaker 2:
Speaker 2: Can be tracked on a shorter time frame basis so you know days are are you know as opposed to weeks or months and you can actually identify when a patient's cancer has evolved to a new mutation that requires a change in therapy so it used to be you a.
Speaker 2: Give a patient a therapy if it was working you'd watch them and if they started getting sicker again you'd say we've got to change their peace and you go back to the drawing board and you try a bunch of things and hope that you found the right therapy before the patient died.
Speaker 2: And it was a very very hit or miss process what's evolving is that when you can sequence on that short time frame you can actually identify this is a new mutation that's what's changing things and this is a targeted therapy for that mutation and you can hit the nail on the head the first time so moving that time frame down not only is a really cool technical story but it's also a really impactful human story and now that we've got this capability the amount of research going into developing these target their pieces just exponentially growing so that's very exciting.
Speaker 2: The middle the middle I think of this is the middle column is and and another huge area about at effort is around open source so Intel is a strong believer in open source and we are always in the top three contributors to Lennix on an open source to her do through our partnership with Cloudera.
Speaker 2: Luster the high performance file system spark which is really where we're seeing a ton of of new you know a ton of the workloads being analyzed and spark now so and then.
Speaker 2: The most recent addition to that that picture is actually.
Speaker 2: Something we call the trusted analytics platform or tap that we have just recently announced as an open source project it is an integrated analytics platform that by the way runs on a WS beautifully around is is is optimized for that.
Speaker 2: That integrates.
Speaker 2: All the aspects of data transformation and ingest.
Speaker 2: And then the data science modeling and a very extensible set of data science modeling tools and capabilities which results in models that can be published into the platform almost like an app store.
Speaker 2: Those models are exposed as services which application developers can immediately deploy at scale so the old the old way of doing things was and you know believe me I've lived through this many times I develop a model that is depending on a whole bunch of different data transformations maybe machine learning on the incoming data and and normalization I build out model and then I have to hand it over to a software engineering team to put it into production they have to translate my mouse into a new programming language and so we have to make sure they get that right which is always challenging because there's so many little details and they you know they're translating it to another language so it takes it takes time and it has risk so all of a sudden now with tap were able to build these models test them out and deploy them at scale I and scale can be you know data coming in from huge amounts of streaming source so it's a it's really a huge leveraging factor and all that that works together so at the end of the day where were really investing and.
Speaker 2: Building tools and open source that help.
Speaker 2: The entire ecosystem get more value out of out of analytics and of course that makes me very happy.

Speaker 0: It says to me like Intel's working at multiple levels a stack the processor the compilers the Dev tools and perils and tools.
Speaker 0: Really all with the idea of making all this just as efficient and productive as possible.
Speaker 1: Yeah absolutely and in fact there's some interesting Intel goodness around security that.
Speaker 1: And performance for algorithms that really that really continues to up the game and and you know make and Tello a really nice place to do these kinds of workloads eight yes and I as a chip level encryption that.
Speaker 1: When it's it allows you to implement encryption across your entire data processing process without picking and choosing where and when you you and crept and decrypt it it adds only a couple to.
Speaker 0: Two to three percent.
Speaker 1: Overhead to your to your processing time and allows you to do things like process healthcare data or credit card transaction data.
Speaker 0: Without.
Speaker 1: Needing to think about every step in the process and whether or not.
Speaker 0: Your your.
Speaker 1: Hand crafted encryption has maybe expose data inadvertently somewhere so it really it really reduces the friction for handling sensitive data and of course that's you know.
Speaker 1: At at the end of the day and and this is you know sort of war we start project where is big data going almost everything is sensitive data some of the most interesting sources of data video images which are.
Speaker 0: Always.
Speaker 1: You always have to assume those are sensitive data you've got people's faces you've got words that could be names ID's or so so that that security just built in from the ground up is extremely cool there's another really interesting capability called T. X. T. which allows control over not only what you know who has access to what's running on a processor but also what data and what computing can be run there and so that allows you to build secure computing enclaves which are which in which literally it's of.
Speaker 0: All.
Speaker 1: That you put data into.
Speaker 0: You.
Speaker 1: Put a computing capability into so it's set of algorithms or some code and then the.
Speaker 1: Neither of those can then be viewed or modified once they're in place so that you can actually.
Speaker 1: Be assured that that data is not exposed that that the code that's running on the data cannot.
Speaker 1: Inadvertently expose or extract inappropriate information and it it really that technology and in is in several manifestations already out there in in sort of proofs of concept and and cutting edge projects that's really cool.
Speaker 0: Is it just kind of good to think about this is having the security built in at the silicon level then.
Speaker 1: Exactly really right at the chip so the the suit the security in the trust start at the chip and then move all the way up the stack which is I think very very exciting and very.
Speaker 1: Empowering because it removes some of those concerns about can we do you know can we put our data on the cloud do computing safely and confidently and it really it really addresses that.
Speaker 0: We've covered a lot of ground already how should we think about all of this going forward.
Speaker 1: Yeah so there's so I sort of hinted at it a little bit but I think there's a couple of different couple of different things to think about one is.
Speaker 1: As we.
Speaker 0: You know we're in the domain where the.
Speaker 1: The the most of the workloads are still operating on structured data we're seeing a lot of value in big data bringing an unstructured data a lot of that is taxed you know your your everything from user user comments to you know.
Speaker 1: Actual you know tax texts or or the text on web pages etcetera that trend will continue but it will continue into video add images as well so right now if you think of how you process images I mean think about for example I was use health care examples right now.
Speaker 0: Your MRI.
Speaker 1: Is not being incorporated into health care work flows except for the to the extent that some experts somewhere has access to the imaging writes a report that's a very minimal I stand constrained representation of what's there and then that gets imported into some electronic record somewhere right so so the image and the the unstructured data itself is actually very far off line from the true analytics that are happening around you as a as a patient.
Speaker 0: That.
Speaker 1: That.
Speaker 0: Is.
Speaker 1: True for most areas of of analytics but what we're gonna see is more and more capability to extract meaning from images from tax that sin images and from video so that that data is really incorporated into our big data analytics stack just like all the other day that is it's not.
Speaker 0: A.
Speaker 1: It's not a separate thing that we go out and and query and then come back it's actually part of our stock now what's interesting is that then leads us to the second big trend which is again something I hinted at earlier which is cognitive computing and we are thinking a lot about how do you incorporate a complete holistic understanding of those unstructured sources as they become more more important to the overall overall analytics stack and so this is an area of huge interest at Intel and and really of course a very exciting area from the point of view of humans interacting with computers and and being able to to extract more more of value from them.
Speaker 0: Barbara thank you for all of this this is really been awesome the future sounds incredible and I can't wait to see how all of this unfolds in the coming months and years.
Speaker 1: How well thank you I mean it's it's you know I I agree the the future is very bright it's it's bright for these young and data scientist candidates who are coming out who are going to be working on really exciting projects and be interacting with the whole diverse group of people it's exciting from the from the point of view of industry that is going to really be able to get value from data in ways that they're going to discover that that in there there is information that they didn't even know was data that they're gonna be able to get insights from so that's all very exciting and of course I I really really love being at Intel where we're at the at the heart of all this all this computing and all this this thought so course having a chance to talk to you about it and put it in the in the context of a W.
